<a name="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>I'm a software engineer in an awesome new-hire program, the <a href="flukenetworks.com/aep">Advanced Engineering Program</a>, at Fluke Networks. I'm also a bit of a workaholic, but I channel that through side projects as much as through my work. Despite that, I still try to find time to get to the climbing gym as often as possible.</p>

<h3>
<a name="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects</h3>

<p>These are some projects I've done over the past couple years. They are mostly projects inspired by something I would want to use.</p>

<h4>
<a name="chalk1up" class="anchor" href="#chalk1up"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Chalk1Up</h4>

<p>Free to use and great for tracking your climbs, especially in the gym! <a href="http://chalk1up.net">Check it out</a>, or dive straight into the <a href="https://climb.chalk1up.net">webapp</a></p>

<p>This is a project that has been ongoing since early 2012. It was started by my desire to track and analyze the progression of my climbing abilities as well as to keep up with my climbing friends as we moved apart. This has been a joint project with <a href="https://github.com/theapedoctor" class="user-mention">@theapedoctor</a>. In addition to the benefit we get out of the app, Cody and I have loved the opportunity to work on some cool new technologies outside of what we do at work. Because of this, we've gone through several code revamps to adopt new techniques and technologies.</p>

<h4>
<a name="synctrip" class="anchor" href="#synctrip"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SyncTrip</h4>

<p>Check it out <a href="http://ross-nordstrom.github.io/SyncTrip/">on github</a> or (<code>coming soon</code>) on an app store near you.</p>

<p>This is a project inspired by my interest in learning about AngularJS, Firebase, and Cordova (Phonegap). Based on my recent experience planning a number of trips with friends and family, I thought that a fully real-time, collaborative trip planner would be really cool. What I think is going to make this project special is not only the ease-of-use, but it's applicability to everyday things. My hope is to make it useful for everyday "trips", such as coordinating a ride to the movies/gym/bars.</p>
